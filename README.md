# Amazon Route Display.


This project uses the dataset from the 2021 Amazon Last Mile Routing Research.  This project is used to display 10 routes and display the locations on a map using Folium. Route Distance and time are also calculated by using the Google Distance Matrix API.  The project also allows for filtering routes by city.

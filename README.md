# Amazon Route Display.


This project uses the dataset from the 2021 Amazon Last Mile Routing Research.  This project is used to display 10 routes and display the locations on a map using Folium. Route Distance and time are also calculated by using the Google Distance Matrix API.  The project also allows for filtering routes by city. 

To run this program, open map.html with live server, then run app.py.  All of this program's functionality is through app.py.
